A Simple Products REST API that connects to a PSQL DB.


Skills, tools and libraries used/practiced:
1.  Used Docker to create PSQL Container. Created two containers, one for PSQL instance and one as data volume.
    a. This allows for PSQL to be updated without impacting database and stored data. 
2. Practiced TDD (Test Driven Development). Developed Tests before implementing API methods. This was to get an introduction into testing on Golang and familiarize myself with the testing and httptest libraries
3. Used Gorilla Mux to handle routing for API   
    a. trying out different libraries, as in my last Go API I used gin to handle routing.
4. Implemented tests for creating new product, updating existing product, deleting an existing product, fetching an existing product, fetching a list of products. 

TODO: 
Add more Tests/Features. Potentially change database and methods.
Deploy API over docker container
Implement testing with Continuous Integration
